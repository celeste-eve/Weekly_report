- looking slay 
- fully functions 
- just need to rearrange some columns DONE

- also make NCF data positive DONE 

- next to do is generate graphs 

for graph generator logic:
- need to add weekly total completed to first DF DONE 

- group by project DONE 
- add up tests completed, remaining, NCF, weekly completed DONE 
- group by project and broard type and redo adding up tests completed, remaining, NCF, weekly completed DONE 
- create graphs for each above catagory 
- 

- need to only print the 3 columns needed and work on the grouped by test type data 

IDEAS:
- do it into PDF 
- graphs to pdf - fpdf - tables and graphs 

- need tot also rename the projects to the more simple name - or just shorten the names
